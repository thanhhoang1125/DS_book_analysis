0,Not a good book to learn Data Science. It's just a notebook of the author which he introduced in the market in printed form. Just  a business trick to earn some quick money. It's clear from the absence of any name of the publisher. No proper explanation on any topic. Couldn't learn R too. Refer to other book for Data Science.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using R (Low Priced Edition): A Primer for Data Scientist

3,"I got the book promptly.  It has that softbound textbook feel.  but good binding not cheap or ready to fall apart.  the intormation in it so far seems interesting and well organized.  its in the ""head first format"" which means there is a lot of nice visual lay out and side notes and some graphics to make understanding the concepts by seeing them when possible.  I like that format.  It is still pretty clean and gets to the point.  but I have only read and used so much of it at this point so I cannot go much farther into the content than that.  -- in short I think it is a solid book to get if one wants to better understand how to interpret social science numbers,  or other scientific numbers that they are shown in a way that they are wise to various ways that data can be spiked and spiced.  how in depth I cannot comment on as I have not fully digested the book.  But it is a book that is designed to be both read and used as a topical reference.  And it has the ""Head First"" style keeping things clean but providing insightful commentary, context and graphical illustrations where it might really speed up or enhance understanding of a particular idea or complicated example.  it also uses bolding in areas where you can pay attention to the new vocabulary you might want to learn in order to lay the ground work for even more technical education in data analysis.  it even has a chapter where it goes over some of the more obscure plug ins for excel that are there for helping a person analyze data.  I would basically treat this book as a nice survey of both the human technical sides of data analysis.  it also covers things like data collection or effective data presentation,  and as I said it refers to several readily available tools like excel for example and how they can be used by someone who wanted to know how to leverage their computer in order tame and extract meaning from data they have been given to interpret.  -- I think that its a useful primer  that is like a survey course in the subject sans the professor.  But how good each section is I cannot comment on as I have only started with the book for a several weeks.  but  what I did read I found completely intelligible and because I am not a total novice at looking at Data,  there were times I could use its nice formatting to skip past explanations I did not need because I already was familiar with them.  If I fall in love with the book I may come back and say so and make my stars 5 instead of a 4 but at this point I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wanted a nice primer that went into to a very serviceable level of detail for a primer or survey type information source.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"

5,"Going through this book for introductory Data Analysis elements has been extremely helpful, especially in later chapters utilizing ""R"".Pros:  1) Great introductory material to Data Analysis, including reporting techniques and later chapters including hands on examples utilizing ""R"".  2) Extremely easy read, was able to cover the material in the span of 1-2 work days and feel as though most of the information has been absorbed.Cons:  1) The binding is really poor (it might just be my copy). When I opened the book I had a handful of pages just fall out. I needed the book for work, so there wasn't much of an option to wait while returning it. I'll just have to fix the binding myself later.  2) Multiple areas that have typos or missing data. For the most part I was able to figure out what was being explained, but some links for data were incorrect.Wishes:  1) A section containing data collection techniques would have been wonderful. Sometimes you aren't given the data, and are expected to retrieve the data needed for analysis.  2) A section covering creating models and analysis based on best/worst/average case estimates from subject matter experts. What to do while waiting for needed data.Aside from the glaring issues mentioned, I would still recommend this book to anyone who needs an introductory book to Data Analysis.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
6,"This was a beautiful book that really refueled my interest for Statistics (which I've been struggling to start learning...even though I know calculus and LOVE mathematics)...but it really caught my eye because it goes into detail about the R statistical programming language.The first few chapters get you going on a specific mindset of how to interpret data, which is VERY important to keep throughout the entire reading of this book.After that groundwork is established, you are taken on a really cool journey of some Excel features (don't freak out...those of you who don't know excel proficiently will be fine in the hands of this book) that you never would've believed were there! You can even use Google Docs to do the same things if you don't have a valid copy of Excel!Finally, R comes into play with all its glory...I would've loved for a deeper dive with this technology, but there are several other books out there in which you can get down and dirty with R (http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Programming-Statistical-Software/dp/1593273843/ and http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor/dp/0596809158/ are my favorites and I own them both on my kindle).I hope that eliminates all your FUD's (Fears, Uncertainties, and Doubts)...go and grab this book RIGHT NOW! You'll be blown away with what you'll be able to do after you read everything here!P.S. It only takes about a week and a half to get through it going at a nice, slow, and comfortable pace...if you're HUNGRY like I was, you can knock it out in about 4 days.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
7,"This book provides an excellent, approachable introduction to data analysis. Although most experienced professionals or advanced students will find this text trivial, it serves as a god starting point for those who are completely new to data analysis. The text provides numerous interactive examples using Excel and R, but the examples do not cover these tools in any great depth. If you're looking to learn more about statistics, data analysis and data mining, this book is a good starting point.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
8,"It's an introductory book, well written, fun to read. I think lots of graduate programs could benefit from some of the examples of the book.

9,"Different problems need different methods to be solved properly. This book takes various examples and lets the reader work through the problems. It is actually fun to read this book. Very well explained. Of course, not all the problems worked 100%, but I have not read a book with examples and problems that all work. Especially, some of my R did not work too well. Other than that it is a great book, and a great way to learn about data analysis.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"

11,"This book does a thorough job covering the concept of data analysis, touching on both the soft side (requirements gathering, mental models) and the technical side (Excel, R).

12,The book itself is useful. I like the way it takes the reader through one example problem at a time and guides the thought process needed to solve the problem. The only thing I don't like is that the print is so faint on some of the pages that I can hardly read it. It looks like a bad printing job or like the presses were running out of ink when this book was created.

14,"This is my current favorite ""general"" book on Excel.  There are a few other books on specific features of Excel (such as Tables, PowerQuery, and VBA) that I would probably rank slightly higher as they provide more depth on their specific areas.  But this book touches a lot of topics while staying very practical.  There are numerous features, tips, and warnings that intermediate and advanced Excel users will benefit from.My only complaint is that the book is printed in black & white.  Some images would benefit from being in color or at a minimum more nuanced shading as the background theme is quite dark.  While annoying on some images, this does not detract from the overall usefulness of the book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Guerrilla Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel: Overcoming Crap Data and Excel Skirmishes

16,"I got this book when I was transitioning to doing data science with Python and was struggling to become familiar with standard tools. It's written by the creator of Pandas, and follows the style of the Pandas documentation: dense, telegraphic, peppered with examples.It's hard work because Wes McKinney often does not articulate why you would need to do something (assuming you are already knowledgeable on the underlying process), and writes like an impatient person who would rather be doing something else. Additionally examples often suffer from being both too long and too short - too long in that almost every example is on a toy dataset created from scratch, too short in that most of those datasets have only 5 or 10 elements and do not always showcase complex operations. Other examples (particularly involving time series) have an overabundance of data that make the critical results hard to spot. Frankly, my first month with Pandas was a miserable one.But I give the book 5 stars both because I came to love Pandas as I got more familiar with it, and because while McKinney is not fun to read, he does pack the book with useful information and it is (mostly) well organized. If anything it would benefit from being longer and with a more patient treatment of larger and more concrete datasets (eg the Titanic passenger dataset used in the Pandas documentation). The initial chapter on the basics of using Python could go - if you need this book, then you don't want to be trying to learn the rudiments of Python from it. If you can accept that you'll need a lot of bookmarks or margin notes to get through a rather steep learning curve, it will reward your persistence.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
17,"This book has been my foundation of using python as a data analyst.This book primarily focuses on the pandas Python library, which is awesome at processing and organizing data (Python pandas is like MS Excel times 100. This is not an exaggeration). It also introduces the reader into numpy (lower level number crunching and arrays), matplotlib (data visualizations), scikitlearn (machine learning), and other useful data science libraries. The book contains other book recommendations for continuing education.Although this would be a challenging book for a brand new Python user, I would still recommend it, especially if you are currently doing a lot of work in MS Excel and/ or exporting data from databases. I had a few false starts learning Python, and my biggest stumbling block was lack of application in what I was learning. This book puts practical tools in the reader's hands very quickly. I personally don't have time to make goofy games etc. that other books have used as practice examples. Despite other reviews criticizing the use of random data throughout the book, I found the examples easy to follow and useful. I would also argue that learning how to generate random data is useful in itself (thus the purpose of the numpy random library), and that there are practical examples throughout the book. Chapter 14 devoted to real-world data analysis examples.I am almost finished with my second time through the book, this time working through every example. This book has been well worth the hours spent in it. For context, I previously relied on Excel, SQL, and some AutoHotKey. This book has significantly improved how I work.Thanks, Wes and team.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
18,Well written by the creator of Pandas.  The author's copious use of code snippets to illustrate his points makes the material very usable.  The snippets are short enough to type by hand so you get the  frequent opportunity to play with the code and really understand the tools being presented.  And Pandas is awesome!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
19,"This book covers all of the basics that you would want to know to get started in programming in Python for data analysis, as the title implies, but it doesn't really offer compelling real-world examples. The data seem to be made up and the analyses don't go into enough detail to help you really learn how pandas and numpy work. Overall this is a decent starter book but you will have to bookmark the python and pandas documentation online if you want to have a reference to all of the functionality those tools have, and there are many places online where you can get better examples to learn from. If you haven't made your mind up about which tool to use for data analysis, I highly recommend checking out dplyr in R, which has an excellent free book online (R for data science, hadley wickham). I find it very easy to learn and it is much easier to set up R and RStudio than it is to set up Python, even though I love Python and Pandas.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
20,"Great reference to get started with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. If you’re already familiar with these libraries, I wouldn’t recommend, as it is easier to just google the functions you’re trying to implement.

Right now they are disjointed examples so it is a bit time consuming understanding the data set and goal for each example when you're looking at 100 examples all using different data.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"

You would expect a book about data analysis to get a little more in depth and complicated.-You can also tell the book was written at different times for each command, there was no natural flow to the book, like you were getting a different author on each page/subject.

37,"Ms. Clarke's follow-up to How to Win With Data Visualizations is a highly useful work that now has a place in my supplemental teaching curriculum. Focused on the processes students need to master to use data effectively, her informal yet informative style leads the reader through the basics of data science in a manner that I have found effective with my students. Well covered topics include the nature of data science, what variables are and how they are used gives a solid foundation for subsequent topics. Particular attention is paid to the nature of data collection (critical in the lab science courses I teach) and how to organize it for later use is well structured. An interesting discussion of ""cleaning your data"" emphasizes something most students seem not to understand when they arrive in the class. Simply put, too many learners figure that if they glean data (from the Internet most often but also from their own labwork or studies) that is the end of it. Ms. Clarke marries the concept of data healthe to personal health and thus makes an excellent connection. She suggests a process that is workable and in practice in my classes in the spring of 2022, yielded a more solid approach than I had used previously.Subsequent discussions build on the foundations Ms. Clarke established earlier on and give the reader fertile ground to grow and individualize their own understanding of how data can be put to one's use be it in education as I do or running a business (which I used to do).Overall I would recommend this work for those interested in upping his/her/she/them/etc.'s skills in data usage.

47,"Professionally, I work a lot with quantitative data, through mathematics/biostatistics, building software, and research design. The world of words has long been a domain that has enchanted me even though symbols have comprised my main language. Recently, my wife has started graduate work using qualitative methods. I decided to fill my deficits in this world by reading this book. I am by no means expert or even experienced in it, but I merely have an interest.This book seems to be the seminal work in its field. The authors share their wisdom and experiences in this accessible textbook, now in a fourth edition. They cover the entire process from design and data collection to building a theory. They talk at length about coding as well as how to present your data. They even have a chapter on writing, with many encouragements to not be boring!The graphics and illustrations in this book are excellent and inspirational. I am always interested in creating visualizations to communicate research data effectively, and this book provided many muses in that regard. They talked about converting written accounts into concept maps and linking those to address “influences and affects” of a weak sort of causality. This book helped slow my mind down about the many moving parts in qualitative research so that I can focus more on a work’s reality and substance.This book is obviously geared towards researchers, whether new or old. The writing and presentation are accessible enough so that graduate students would be well-served by reading this work. Practitioners, of course, can benefit as well, but they likely would have read one of the prior three editions of this book. Those who, like me, are involved in other parts of the research enterprise can learn about their colleagues’ work, too. Finally, those who spend significant time building visuals to communicate concepts can learn from these authors’ analytical techniques.After finishing this work, I’m inspired about the myriad of ways non-quantitative data can be analyzed and concisely communicated to readers – especially in ways that aren’t written prose. Poetry, artful presentations, summarizing graphics, and matrix-tables together can create a mosaic to comport meaningful and accurate understanding to readers.

54,"Experiencia en estudios de posgrado (versión impresa, pasta blanda)Cada situación es única. La mía al menos, fue carecer de formación y experiencia previa en procesos de análisis de datos cualitativos para mostrar un desempeño competente a nivel posgrado. Llegó el momento en el que resultó necesario ir más allá de lo que la universidad pública estatal podía ofrecer, tanto en recursos (dado su limitado acceso a un acervo básico de libros actualizados en el tema y la limitación de acceso a bases de datos electrónicas) como en orientación inmediata. Es aquí donde el libro de Análisis Cualitativo de Datos de Miles, Huberman & Saldaña (2020) en su cuarta edición ilumina las posibilidades.Acostumbrado a la oferta competente de productos editados por Sage (no todos, pero sí la mayoría), la posibilidad de leer previamente el índice y algo del contenido en línea a través de Google Libros, me convenció de que sería una buena guía... y no me defraudó.Con un lenguaje accesible, siempre abierto a considerar que cada caso de investigación es único y que los contenidos presentados son sugerencias resultado de experiencias profesionales (pero no por eso recetas únicas de cómo proceder), el libro guía al lector a través de tres etapas para: 1) Tener una idea básica, pero amplia de lo que implica el análisis de datos cualitativos, 2) Cómo manejar los datos obtenidos en términos de: exploración, descripción, ordenamiento, explicación y predicción y 3) Cómo obtener y verificar las conclusiones obtenidas.Al ser una edición actualizada (al momento de esta reseña al menos), el contenido contempla un elenco de herramientas tecnológicas especializadas para el análisis de datos con funciones que permitan agilizar su procesamiento (recordando siempre que son solo eso, herramientas, no sustitutos del procesamiento intelectual que corresponde al investigador).Con una lógica de ""Descripción --> aplicaciones --> Ejemplo(s)"", el libro asegura la facilidad de comprensión para casi todos los casos que presenta. Las ilustraciones y tablas que acompañan sus explicaciones, son sencillas de seguir e interpretar como ejemplos.Opté por la versión impresa dado que, aunque la edición digital es más ""accesible"" en costo, eventualmente depende de dispositivos electrónicos para su consulta, algo que no siempre resulta benéfico a largo plazo (habrá a quienes les resulte indistinto el formato, pero yo lo he intentado y las versiones impresas facilitan más mi concentración). Tal vez, buscando maximizar las ganancias y reducir costos, en la versión impresa el formato del libro es relativamente grande y las letras de tamaño pequeño (como un Times New Roman de 10 pts. aprox.), resultando en un formato poco práctico para su manejo. Comparativamente ""The Coding manual for cualitative resarches"" (Saldaña, 2021), tiene un poco más de páginas pero su tamaño de formato resulta mucho más práctico de manejar.El gran pero es el precio que, en México al menos, son palabras mayores (alrededor de USD$80.00 al tipo de cambio el día de la reseña). Ojalá que este tipo de publicaciones, que bien podrían ser libros de texto para mejorar el proceso de investigadores/as en formación, tuvieran un costo más accesible sin tener que optar por versiones digitales.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Qualitative Data Analysis: A Methods Sourcebook

57,"Just what my review title says. This book is an excellent and clearly written introduction to working with the R language. There are many step by step examples that start at the beginning with installing R.  That said, the book itself is rather flimsy and arrived with a bent back cover and some crumpled pages.

60,"Dr. Robert I. Kabacoff's R in Action has been my go-to R reference book since its first edition came out in 2011. I reviewed the second edition here on Amazon in 2015 and have been relying on that book since then. I have never used R frequently enough to get really good at it. Yet, when I do need to work with it, I have grabbed my now well-used copy of R in Action, Second Edition, and found the instructions and examples needed to complete my tasks. (It's still a good book for getting started with R, by the way.) That said, R in Action, Third Edition, is a real eye-opener for me. I didn't realize the program had gained so many enticing new features and capabilities over the past seven years. Kabacoff's updated book includes ""extensive coverage of tidyverse approaches to data management and analysis."" At least nine of the book's chapters and  three of its appendices have been expanded and updated. Some corrections and changes also have been made to examples and descriptions carried over from the second edition. In all, more than 200 pages of new material are presented. Some of the new sections include how to use RStudio ""for programming, debugging, report writing, and package creation..."" The package creation descriptions also cover ""how to share and promote your packages through CRAN, GitHub, and software-generated websites."" The latest edition is a hefty book, now nearly 600 pages in print form. Many of us today are dealing with new surges of data, and we need better ways to manipulate it, format it, display it, and manage it for the most efficient storage and retrieval. The tidyverse approach to data management and data analysis has its critics and its advocates. I don't know enough about it yet to render an opinion. But whether you are an R newcomer, an intermediate user, or someone who uses R extensively each day, you should consider having R in Action, Third Edition, within easy reach. You'll likely need it in the months and years ahead.My thanks to Manning Publications for sending a review copy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R in Action, Third Edition: Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse"

63,"I bought the ebook directly from the publisher, Manning. I especially liked the examples and the practical approach. I have used and taught R for a number of years, and I found the examples useful and will be using some of them in class, too. However, I would not recommend this book for absolute beginners: the author has opted to base his exposition on RStudio, ggplot2 and ""Tidyverse"" packages like dplyr, instead of sticking to base R and introducing powerful high performing packages like data.table. I do not follow his reasoning (""most powerful and popular""), certainly not when it comes to learning R in the first place. Unfortunately, many authors rewrite their books because they feel that the ""Tidyverse"" and its approach is the way of the future. I have a more sceptical position towards these developments (please check out ""TidyverseSceptic"" on GitHub for more details). Hence, for beginners, I think the 2nd edition of this book is to be preferred over the 3rd edition. The 2nd edition is just brilliant, and I am glad that I obtained it from Manning for free when buying the 3rd edition. In practice, I often use the ""livebook"" version of the book (another innovation by Manning - see picture).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R in Action, Third Edition: Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse"
64,"When I first applied for my PhD program, I knew I was in trouble if I did not have a solid understanding of R.

66,"I used the first edition of this work to learn R. I Found it a pleasant textbook, methodical, exhaustive and clearly written. As such it was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed. In the meantime, much time has passed; R has evolved and many novel things were introduced. Perhaps the most important of these is the Tidyverse family of libraries. This third edition has grown to include all these new developments. It has become encyclopaedic in size and can be considered a standard work on the subject. If one has to choose one book for work or study, this is the one. The clarity of exposition found in this work is also due to the numerous clear and beautiful illustrations. Apart from a panoramic view of the R programming language it is also a great help in implementing most statistical techniques and to solve inherent programming problems.

71,"I will admit I was a Perl snob and thought Python was for beginners.  Fast forward and now we see Python being used in AI, Machine Learning and more general areas.  The reward for snobbery is to have to play catch up.This book as the title says is a beginner’s book.  And I do mean it is for a beginner who has never scripted in-depth if at all.You will learn the basics of programming with the book.  It is a “no frills” simplified approach to learning the basics of programing with Python.So, you can measure what is offered; these are the chapters:• The First Impression• Installing Python• Learning Python from Scratch• Introduction to Statements and Loops• Operators – The Types and Their Uses• Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries• Functions• Classes and Exception Handling• Inheritance, Modules, and Packages• Next stepsAs you can see the basics.  If you are an active scripter; you may find this book a waste of your time as it is writing for a beginner and does things like double spacing for an easier read.You will not find many advanced things like system administrator or web functions.If you have not seriously scripted in a while and or want a simple introduction to Python, this book could help.There is a workbook which is part of the book.  The questions and lessons are ok.  The final project is the writing a classical hangman game.  You get the answers and example code for the chapters.  The final project is for you to do and is intended for you to explore and improve on the game.I only used this book as I found I was not paying attention to a more detail book. I was “I already know this” on many things.

72,I am very pleased with the quality of the content in this book. First time programmers will get a lot of value. I was a programmer for an aerospace company in the dark ages (1976-1986) so for me it is a really quick read and it does cover all of the elements of the Python language quite well. The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the binding. About every 10th page is not connected to the spine.

90,"As a Monty Python fan I've patiently waited for this movie to come to Blu-ray(2012) but didn't have very high expectations that it would look and sound all that good. Well I was wrong. It looks and sounds Great! And I'm not going to tell you it's an excellent movie, you already know that--great British humor(actually universal humor), ridiculously funny, great actors. And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).Sony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.The audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable. Overall, it is very enjoyable with nice use of surround sound and I think most people will be more than happy with it.LOTS OF EXTRAS: (Some New Stuff)Lost Animations (1080p, 12:55) Features Gilliam animations deleted from the film. ***New for this blu-ray release***Outtakes & Extended Scenes (1080p, 18:57)***New for this blu-ray release***MORE INCLUDED EXTRAS:(Some HD, some SD)Subtitles for People Who Do Not Like the Film (From Henry IV pt. 11).3 Mindless Sing-Alongs (480p, 5:10).How To Use Your Coconuts (An educational Film) (480p, 2:58)Quest for the Holy Grail Locations (480p, 47:00) Special DocumentaryCast Directory Photo Gallery (1080p).Lego Knights (480p, 1:43): A lego recreation of the ""Camelot's a silly place"" scene.Meanwhile, King Arthur & Sir Belvedere...Elephant & CastleRun Away!The Tale of Sir RobinThe Tale of Sir LancelotBBC Film NightRe-release TrailerThere are a couple more Commentaries, a Japanese version of 2 scenes(English subtitles), a UV Digital Copy and some credits AND the first subtitle from the opening credits that was missing on the Special Edition DVD is back.

91,"I've been a Monty Python fan my entire life, and a huge fan of this film in particular. This is the best that MP&THG has ever looked, and perhaps as good as it ever will, or even can, look or sound.Instead of rehashing what has already been said about the film itself and the shiny new 1080p video, I'd like to focus on a few of the extras, and what exactly is different about this release compared to the previous DVD release.Most of the extras (Holy Grail locations, etc.) were all on the earlier DVD, but the new additions, the Outtakes and Lost Animations, are real gems available for the first time only on this Blu-Ray.The Outtakes consist of longer versions of some scenes, which were understandably cut or shortened, but there are also some alternate takes and screw-ups with the cast forgetting lines or laughing in the middle of a take. It's all great fun, and a humorous look behind the scenes at an already drop-dead hilarious movie.Terry Gilliam's Lost Animations are a hoot. We see a few spare parts that may not have had any particular intent, but there is also an extended opening to The Tale of Sir Robin, involving a collapsing cathedral, a stray rock catapulted into the sky and knocking out a flying dragon-like creature which then falls into the title card, impaling its mouth, collapsing, thus creating the ""R"" in ""Robin.""  And there is also an extended opening to ""The Tale of Sir Lancelot"" in which a cartoon Lancelot battles a giant slug. Total Gilliam lunacy at his stream-of-consciousness best!The only cut scene I wish had been included as an extra is ""King Brian the Wild,"" which is a scene that was written but never shot. It appears only as a pencil sketch animation with sound on the Holy Grail video game that came out during the Dark Ages of video games. Unless it's an easter egg on this disc, or if it appears in the ""Holy Book of Days,"" which I have not had a chance to explore yet.There are a couple of things missing from the Blu-Ray, including the ""Follow the Rabbit"" feature from the previous DVD. That feature would be useless here anyway, since the new ""Holy Book of Days"" downloadable feature promises to be far more extensive and comprehensive.  Also, the false opening ""Dentist on the Job"" short is not at the start of the film. Not a deal-breaker, of course, but if you are fond of that ephemeral opening gag, then hang on to your DVD.The Blu-Ray menus are much better than the DVD menus, which I always thought were rather tedious and impossible to by-pass.The various audio tracks, commentaries and subtitles (including the Japanese language track and the Henry VI subtitles) are all there, but on the DVD the default audio was the original mono track. Here the default is the more recent stereo remaster, including Michael Palin's re-recording of the narration.This Blu-Ray release is a very impressive return to a fantastic comedy that has stood the test of time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python And The Holy Grail

94,"You know the scene: the Pythons riding through the countryside on their faithful invisible steeds, clip-clopping of hooves provided by a lackey clapping coconut shell halves together, in their search for the Holy Grail. They encounter all manner of obstacles and strange characters, from oppressed peasants who object to King Arthur's very existence, to three-headed knights who block their path, to a wizened gatekeeper for whom they must answer three questions, to a killer bunny.Monty Python is an acquired taste, and this is their best film to help in the acquisition. Holy Grail is a highlight of a youngster's coming of age, providing a host of quotes and situations that are referenced forever after: the buxom maiden whom the duke tells his effete son to marry because she has ""vast [slight pause] tracts of land""; the French knights somehow ensconced in a castle in England, who tell Arthur they don't want to join the quest for the Holy Grail because they ""already have one""; the knight who suffers a ""flesh wound"" as his limbs are lopped off one by one; and the blessing of the Holy Hand Grenade for use against the killer bunny.The Holy Grail was filmed with modest production values, but the Blu-ray picture quality is surprising, showing greatly improved colors and details. Although not the type of film one watches for reference quality video, it is nonetheless very pleasant to take in all the hilarious nonsense with a better picture. Numerous special features are offered on the Blu-ray, mostly ported over directly from the two-disc DVD edition. Like most Python productions nothing is taken too seriously, not the characters, nor the sets and costumes, and certainly not the story. But this casual appearance should not hide the fact that these guys are seriously funny, their stories endearing, their films memorable. King Arthur decides at one point that they will not return to Camelot just now, because it is ""a silly place"". Holy Grail is a silly movie, and it should be visited early and often in hope of finding still further silliness.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python And The Holy Grail

115,"I consider myself an 'early intermediate' Pythonista, with about three years of self-taught experience in the language, bolstered by all the good resources out there online. I first ran across Dan's page/blog through a Twitter link, I think, and have really enjoyed his Python Tricks emails. Some of them aren't news to me, but there have been multiple instances where they've given me a key insight into the behavior of Python, or an idea that's helped me improve my projects.As he notes in the Introduction, this book grew out of the Python Tricks emails, and it really shows. Dan has a knack for constructing code snippets that illustrate Python concepts in very few lines, and also for writing extremely clear descriptions of why they behave as they do. Further, even though Dan has years of Python experience, it seems clear to me he hasn't lost the sense of the ways in which Python can be confusing to new learners. I've only sampled here and there from his Buffet at this point, but have already gained two new concrete pieces of knowledge: bytearrays are mutable whereas bytes are not; and all it takes to create an abstract base class is to use metaclass=ABCMeta and decorate as needed with @abstractmethod. Even though I'd looked at the Python documentation for both of these before, I never quite understood either of them. But, Dan's phrasing and presentation made them crystal clear on my first read.One additional thing I like about the book is how Dan has included bits and pieces of his philosophy on Python, programming, writing good code, etc. Some people might be turned off by the editorializing, I suppose, but I really appreciate that the book provides these sorts of ""meta"" perspectives.All in all, an excellent resource for someone with modest to moderate Python experience looking to round out their knowledge of some of the more subtle features/behaviors of the language.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features

118,"I am not a big fan of reading books in general. But, I just finished reading through every chapters in this book after 13 days of daily reading. I found this book both very fun and informative. If you are looking for something more than beginner python tutorials, this book will surely do a good job to satisfy some of the thirst that you had. Here are some Pros/Cons of the book.Pros:1. Good book material quality and size (small but also perfect thickness to carry around).2. Great and interesting topics with intermediate+ level examples.3. Concepts were very well described.Cons:1. Books lacks colors, It seems like HTMl version of this must have used some Markdown but the book is just plain black/white texts.2. Wish there were some more examples per topics.3. Chapters/Topics are short enough that *key takeaways* section can seem bit redundant. Maybe some kind of *quiz* or some kind of *small mission for readers to go find out* type of section would been more useful IMO.But, I really enjoyed this book. So how about you give it a try as well?",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features
119,"Many of the topics in the book were presented in a  straightforward manner. It's fun to sort of get lost in the concepts. I feel that there was a need for some practical use cases that the average person?.. No, novice programmer can intuit. Still, the author did well in explaining the cases in conjunction with how the technology works. It made me interested in the communities he mentions at the end of the book which seem like viable resources for someone at that novice level interested in progressing this skill set at their own pace.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features
120,"The main reason why I bought the book is because I like Dan's blog.I consider my Python level to be intermediate. I have completed reading 100 pages(1/3 of the book). Although the content is decent, this feels like it is targeted more towards beginner(not an absolute beginner) than intermediate level. I am hardly learning anything new that is already not in Fluent Python (which is a big ass book in comparison but provides better understanding of the Pythonic tricks) or in Raymond Hettinger or David Beazley’s videos on YouTube.I will update the review once I finish reading the entire book.Update: I finished reading the book and I still stand by what I said earlier. If you have time and patience, go with Fluent python. Other than the new style string formatting, rest of the content is mostly covered in that.That does not mean this is not a good book. I really loved some of the chapters like generators, iterators. The examples were more simple and easy to understand. Overall, I found this book to be more of a tutorial than a reference material. Mainly because I use the excellent pymotw website for the Collections part of the book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features
121,"I'm an advanced python user and have worked at several startups, Google, and Microsoft, but I still found several tips in here that were new to me, and many others that I only knew because I'd learned them from colleagues when I worked at Google. For instance, I would usually just define an __str__ method on my custom classes and be lazy and not implement __repr__. But the book points out that if you want be lazy, just define __repr__ alone, as the default behavior of __str__ will call your __repr__ function anyway. I should have known this already but somehow it's a little thing I had missed when learning python. There are lots of bits of info like this: some you'll probably already know, but you might be surprised by a couple little tricks.One outstanding feature of the book is a short recap after each section, giving simple rules of thumb to to follow. This cleared up a lot of uncertainty for me about some python best practices.

I have always been amazed by students or colleagues who seem to have this uncanny ability to ""master"" a language like Python.  I have purchased many Python books over the years but none of them really felt like the fit.  This one does.  I feel this book will take from up from beginning (functions, for loops, arrays, conditionals) to a more advanced programming using programming constructs beyond the basics.  I also like the authors videos, blog and overall attention to detail in preparing this book and his honest marketing.

It looks and sounds Great! And I'm not going to tell you it's an excellent movie, you already know that--great British humor(actually universal humor), ridiculously funny, great actors. And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).Sony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.The audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable.

134,"I've been a Monty Python fan my entire life, and a huge fan of this film in particular. This is the best that MP&THG has ever looked, and perhaps as good as it ever will, or even can, look or sound.Instead of rehashing what has already been said about the film itself and the shiny new 1080p video, I'd like to focus on a few of the extras, and what exactly is different about this release compared to the previous DVD release.Most of the extras (Holy Grail locations, etc.) were all on the earlier DVD, but the new additions, the Outtakes and Lost Animations, are real gems available for the first time only on this Blu-Ray.The Outtakes consist of longer versions of some scenes, which were understandably cut or shortened, but there are also some alternate takes and screw-ups with the cast forgetting lines or laughing in the middle of a take. It's all great fun, and a humorous look behind the scenes at an already drop-dead hilarious movie.Terry Gilliam's Lost Animations are a hoot. We see a few spare parts that may not have had any particular intent, but there is also an extended opening to The Tale of Sir Robin, involving a collapsing cathedral, a stray rock catapulted into the sky and knocking out a flying dragon-like creature which then falls into the title card, impaling its mouth, collapsing, thus creating the ""R"" in ""Robin.""  And there is also an extended opening to ""The Tale of Sir Lancelot"" in which a cartoon Lancelot battles a giant slug. Total Gilliam lunacy at his stream-of-consciousness best!The only cut scene I wish had been included as an extra is ""King Brian the Wild,"" which is a scene that was written but never shot. It appears only as a pencil sketch animation with sound on the Holy Grail video game that came out during the Dark Ages of video games. Unless it's an easter egg on this disc, or if it appears in the ""Holy Book of Days,"" which I have not had a chance to explore yet.There are a couple of things missing from the Blu-Ray, including the ""Follow the Rabbit"" feature from the previous DVD. That feature would be useless here anyway, since the new ""Holy Book of Days"" downloadable feature promises to be far more extensive and comprehensive.  Also, the false opening ""Dentist on the Job"" short is not at the start of the film. Not a deal-breaker, of course, but if you are fond of that ephemeral opening gag, then hang on to your DVD.The Blu-Ray menus are much better than the DVD menus, which I always thought were rather tedious and impossible to by-pass.The various audio tracks, commentaries and subtitles (including the Japanese language track and the Henry VI subtitles) are all there, but on the DVD the default audio was the original mono track. Here the default is the more recent stereo remaster, including Michael Palin's re-recording of the narration.This Blu-Ray release is a very impressive return to a fantastic comedy that has stood the test of time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition)

137,"You know the scene: the Pythons riding through the countryside on their faithful invisible steeds, clip-clopping of hooves provided by a lackey clapping coconut shell halves together, in their search for the Holy Grail. They encounter all manner of obstacles and strange characters, from oppressed peasants who object to King Arthur's very existence, to three-headed knights who block their path, to a wizened gatekeeper for whom they must answer three questions, to a killer bunny.Monty Python is an acquired taste, and this is their best film to help in the acquisition. Holy Grail is a highlight of a youngster's coming of age, providing a host of quotes and situations that are referenced forever after: the buxom maiden whom the duke tells his effete son to marry because she has ""vast [slight pause] tracts of land""; the French knights somehow ensconced in a castle in England, who tell Arthur they don't want to join the quest for the Holy Grail because they ""already have one""; the knight who suffers a ""flesh wound"" as his limbs are lopped off one by one; and the blessing of the Holy Hand Grenade for use against the killer bunny.The Holy Grail was filmed with modest production values, but the Blu-ray picture quality is surprising, showing greatly improved colors and details. Although not the type of film one watches for reference quality video, it is nonetheless very pleasant to take in all the hilarious nonsense with a better picture. Numerous special features are offered on the Blu-ray, mostly ported over directly from the two-disc DVD edition. Like most Python productions nothing is taken too seriously, not the characters, nor the sets and costumes, and certainly not the story. But this casual appearance should not hide the fact that these guys are seriously funny, their stories endearing, their films memorable. King Arthur decides at one point that they will not return to Camelot just now, because it is ""a silly place"". Holy Grail is a silly movie, and it should be visited early and often in hope of finding still further silliness.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition)

This book is not for the casual Python programmer, however.  I have been writing Python code for more than twenty years, but I learn new things or sharpen my knowledge with every chapter.

152,"First of all, as to the content of the book: This is THE best book on Python in my opinion. It's the way to understand how Python works so that you can dance with it, not just sit on the sidelines wondering why things are the way they are. Get it, read it, and you WILL know Python at a much more substantive level than most Python programmers who have not read this.Many people (including the author) may warn you that this is an ""advanced book"" or that it focuses on the obscure topic of metaprogramming with __dunder__() methods in Python, but it turns out that the way it explains Python using these things ends up teaching you just exactly what you need to know to use the language effectively. It's (probably) not a book for a beginning programmer who needs humor and cartoons to keep them awake, but for anyone with a technical orientation who wants to just be told how things work, this is the best book you could ask for. It does not tell you anything you do not need to know.My advice for intelligent, motivated, technical people (like you I suspect) who want to learn Python is to first go through the official Python Tutorial (on the official Python website) if you need an introduction to the features of the language and then read this book from cover to cover.It's just a great book.Now a note on the production of this edition by O'Rielly: I was disappointed that they didn't do a nicer job with the production and printing of the 2nd edition. It's printed in monochrome on heavy paper which makes the physical book a serious tome at around 1,000 pages. For the price they're asking I was hoping to see something like the quality of their ""Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 2nd Edition"" which is printed on thinner, higher-quality paper, in full color, and the paper flows and feels great in your hand and even though it's a big book it's really nice to own in that form. For Fluent Python, I recommend reading it in one of the electronic formats like Kindle or O'Reilly Learning, or I believe there's a source for an official purchasable PDF version that the author Tweeted about a while back. I have not seen the Kindle version myself, but I was very happy with the O'Reilly Learning online version and I presume the Kindle experience should be similar.In any case, it gets all the stars, and you should own a copy in some medium.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming"

154,"Of course, we programmers know that everything we could want to know is out there, in fragmentary form, on the web. But I have a tediously fastidious mind that likes to keep the distinction clear between what I know and what I have yet to find out. As such, books are my preferred approach to a systematic learning process. I would have been very grateful then if someone had told me at the start of my Python journey that what and all I needed to read was the Tutorial at python.org, David Beasley's epically concise Python Distilled, and this, the 'lizard book'. This book demands a close, paragraph by paragraph reading and maybe some re-reading of some sections till full or at least deeper understanding dawns. After this book there isn't really anywhere to go except the source code and the dry and voluminous language docs. Whatever isn't actually in the book is there on the accompanying fpy.li website.A first point is that this is not a book for the beginner. One needs to have a reasonable grasp of the language having worked a while with it, being able to muddle along, but also knowing one is just muddling along and wishing to get things onto a more solid foundation.As such, I'm anxious not to let prospective readers be put off by the review that asserts that the author does not get to the point. There is no flab in this book. It is a big book, but a serious programmer could only wish that the book was even bigger and even more detailed. Python is as much an ideology about how to do things properly as a programming language. It is deceptively easy to muddle along in Python on the basis of what one has already come to know in more 'primitive' programming languages. But for the programmer determined to get the best from a language that has a near endless toolbox of subtle features and constructs the learning curve goes far deeper and longer than a superficial comprehension can suspect. Perhaps that reviewer is thinking about the soapbox sections at the end of each chapter in which the author considers the merits or not of particular decisions made in the complex, democratic language design process? If so, it should be pointed out that even here the author is inviting the reader to think more deeply and clearly about why such features were implemented as they were and what the alternatives might be.I have two complaints, notwithstanding which I still regard the book as indispensable and insubstitutable. Firstly, I wish very much there was a hardcover edition because the kind of reading this book demands means that the paperback cover is not going to survive even as much as a first reading. I would also like to see, perhaps in a future edition, a more comprehensive and systematic index. Again and again, one encounters situations where we know we have read something about this in 'the lizard book' but finding the requisite nugget or gem is not always that easy. The book does not work particularly well as a reference.A final point is that the book is a great pleasure to read without any loss of clarity. Although the author's knowledge is clearly formidable, he invites the reader to accompany him on a journey as a fellow traveller, pointing out the many small discoveries he has made in his own passage. One quickly comes to feel assured that even where one's own understanding might falter, everything you need to achieve understanding is written down there if one just reads it carefully enough. Few technical authors pass this test. The man is a natural teacher who always places himself in the point of view of the student and proceeds from there.A huge, rigorous, fractally detailed but profoundly enjoyable journey of a book. As simple as possible but no simpler. The mighty and beautiful 'lizard book'",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming"

165,"I freely admit I bought this movie knowing how bad it was, and for David Hewlett. I've adored him for years now.The plot without giving anything away, involves a millionaire with a reputation for finding rare or somehow altered animals (bigger is better!) and creating a semi-controlled hunt for them involving other rich folks with too much money and time on their hands. Our villain Broddick (Adam Kendrick) gets a hold of a giant python intending it for one of his hunts and things naturally don't go as planned.On the other side we have our heroes, Monica a plucky marine biologist (Jamie Bergman) whose developing sensors for dolphins as the navy uses them in dives, in hopes of mapping both the environment the sensors are in, and all that can be seen in it it's field. Joining her is Dr. Emmett (the always fantasticDavid Hewlett) a reptile and snake expert whose own specific research involves Betty, a giant genetically enhanced scarlet boa whose been bred in hopes of creating a universal anti-venom.When the python gets loose, as giant big damn snakes tend to do, and Samuel L. Jackson isn't around, the government in the form of Agent Sharp (Kirk B. R. Woller) decides to try and let the giant boa take it on and you have your standard cable movie creature feature plot.What makes this one different is that it manages to walk the line very carefully between being too silly or tongue in cheek, and taking itself way too seriously. The script is several notches above several of the large beast vs large beast movies of the last decade and the cast is too.Make no mistakes, a great movie that will be long remembered, this is not. There are naturally a few cringe worthy lines and wooden performances, but for an enjoyable ""bad"" movie with a ridiculous premise, a decent amount of laughs and action, Boa vs Python isn't a bad way to spend a Saturday. And if creature flicks are your thing, I think you'll enjoy it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs. Python
166,"I orginally saw this movie on the Sci-fy Channel.  At the time I thought it was better than most of their movies which isn't saying a lot as most if their stuff is drek.  Upon watching the streamed movie from Amazon, I was struck by the poor special effects and the lack of screen time for the giant snakes.  Still, it is better than most of the sci-fi/horror movies I have streamed recently.  My 4 star review is based on that comparison.  Just as a movie this thing is 3 or maybe even 2 stars.

167,"This is about a big game hunter who arranges to have a giant boa (or maybe it's the python) flown in so that he and his fellow hunters can have some fun going after it.  But it escapes and gets down into the sewer system.  Some government people just happen to have an equally huge python (or maybe it's the boa), so naturaly they decide to release the second snake to hunt down the first.  Sounds like a fine idea to me.Fairly average B movie.  I've only seen the edited for TV version, but it looked like the unedited version might have some T&A.  The characters are average, acting was average (for a B movie), the action was pretty slow.  The snakes are so obviously CGI that watching them fight is more like a video game than a movie.  Really no suspense, and when the snakes attack, since they're put in afterwards via computer animation, the actors don't really seem to react to them.  That pretty much kills any excitement.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and it is somewhat funny in parts.  There's a pretty girl in it, which is the only reason I sat through the whole thing.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs.

169,"Where to begin.  It is a low budget B movie, with terrible special effects.  The acting is only so-so, and the script is poor.  It is difficult to know if the movie was meant to be serious or simply high camp.  It is more campy.  But not that good for a genuinely campy movie.  They throw in a lot of stereotypes.  There is the TV reporter that seeks to make it big with a blockbuster report.  There are some real Yahoos among the hunting party.  And Agent Sharpe is the no nonsense FBI agent.  And there are so many unforced plot flaws.  It was referenced in the heat of the sun, the snake would seek out the coolest spot.  It is a reptile, and they seek warm places.  A lot of the movie takes place in what is supposed to a water treatment plant for Philadelphia, and when the snake gets into it, water is shutoff for the entire city.  None of that makes sense with the piping and the steam and pulses of steam.  And besides, that is not how Philadelphia gets and treats its water.  And they throw in a snake in heat, with amorous intent with the other snake.  To give more realism, the vehicles have Pennsylvania license plates, but on the front bumper.  Pennsylvania utilizes a single plate on the rear of the car.  But then it was filmed in Bulgaria.  They do throw in nudity.  A bathing scene aboard a 747 plane in the first 12 minutes of the film, quite revealing, and topless dancers near the end of the film.  The movie is simply a mess.  I had hope near the beginning that the film aimed for high comedy.  It might have been better if they had been able to keep on that track.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs. Python
170,"The filmmakers took a supposedly `humorous' approach to this film, assuming that if they didn't take it seriously no one else would (?).  The plot involves a millionaire wacko (Adam Kendrick as Broddick) who decides to invite a crackpot team of nitwits to hunt a BIG snake he just happens to have for just such an occasion.  Needless to say, said snake escapes requiring several groups to track and kill it.  Enter the FBI as one such contingent.  They play it smart by turning to an expert to help them pursue this snake.  Fortunately, herpetologist Dr. Emmett (David Hewlett) is available and he teams up with a marine biologist (Jaime Bergman) to use his GIANT snake as a bloodhound of sorts (because apparently everyone in this movie just happens to have a HUGE snake when one is required!?).  It is a weird premise that also demands full nudity because nothing screams horror movie like a woman taking a bath on a plane!!!I can't say that it looks as though a lot of effort and care when into the making of this movie.  It was obviously made to cash in on a trend.  That it failed to meet anyone's standard for excellence is apparent in the results.

183,"This is the fourth game-oriented Python book I've purchased to help my kids learn coding skills. So far, I think this one is my favorite book for graphical gaming titles. I purchased the paperback version; it's over 200 pages, and each page is full of practical skills and helpful teaching. Every chapter tackles a different game and breaks down exactly what's going on and how to apply the programming concepts that the authors are teaching you. After two necessary intro chapters on getting a very beginner-level knowledge of Python, you're then provided 9 chapters that help you build increasingly sophisticated and fun games.  We actually enjoy playing these games because they have the right mixture of low-res (retro) graphics and simple interactivity.==Who is this book for? ==Parents with kids as young as 7 or 8 can help their little ones begin a real programming language. You don't need pseudo-coding or fancy robots to learn to code--just this book and a free copy of Python will do the trick. You can even use the $35 Raspberry Pi as your computer if you have a TV and a keyboard lying around. For older kids in their tweens or early teens, this book will be all they need, even with no help from adults.==How is Coding Games in Python different?==This book is a great balance of depth and fun. There isn't nearly as much theory and explanation as the excellent titles by Al Sweigart have, but this book does provide enough detail and troubleshooting advice to help you glimpse what's going on under the hood. The authors even teach you to use a graphical module called Pygame Zero, which is a lightweight way to start coding games with graphics. It's also a great introduction to the full-blown Pygame later on.==Any Downsides to this book?==This isn't a substitute for a real computer science class. I felt that Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python (by Sweigart) introduced you to most of the concepts and theory to succeed in a high school level computer science curriculum. Instead, this book focused on getting plenty of experience, even if that means that your kid doesn't necessarily know everything that's going on with the code.

I would not consider myself particularly mathematically inclined and can still get through them with some effort, and enjoy the challenge of learning something new and putting some long-unused brain cells to work, but it may be frustrating if you really hate math. There is always the option to skip exercises you don't like, of course.I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in programming, or wanting to learn Python, beginners included.

221,"I've read a few books from O'Reilly in that past and have generally enjoyed them. What I expected in this case was a thorough introduction to some of the core Python packages for algorithmic trading and a rundown of how the author thinks they should be integrated into a larger trading system. I was a disappointed to find only a short discussion of the capabilities of the oanda and FXCM packages and thought the authors suggested trading system to be, at times, contradictory.Also, given the wealth of prediction algorithms available in Python, I expected a more systematic review of such algorithms and some associated insights. However, only a handfull of algorithms were up for discussion and let's just say that they left a lot to the imagination. The discussion of backtesting was also largely simplified and ignored many of the real-world practicalities that have the potential to adversely affect the outcome.The lack of quality editing is glaringly obvious.

230,"Last year I started my first project assignment on deep learning, and puzzled my way through it using Stack Overflow. It was a disjointed and somewhat awkward way to learn, but I did in fact get a lot of the basics. However, when I saw this book I suddenly realized it was past time to do some proper reading and learning on the topic, and fired off an order. Reading it now gives a series of 'oh yeah', and 'aha' moments, as it connects up various loose ends I'd come across and never properly registered. It's written in a semi-conversational style that is similar to how you'd get information from a co-worker, if you had a co-worker that was knowledgeable in deep learning. For example, it has a style where there's an occasional contra-example given to show what something ISN'T, alongside what it IS. I didn't have any such co-worker, but if I'd had this book instead of just stack overflow it would have been a big help.

234,"I read Murach's Python for Data Analysis because I work with database administration and data analysis. I am trying to learn more about using about tools to perform the analysis and Python is being used many shops. I had previously used Spyder as a Python IDE, but was not aware of using Juypter Lab as an IDE. Section 2 was entitled “The critical skills for success on the job” and had chapters on obtaining data, cleaning it, preparing it and then analyzing the data. There was information in the chapters that was good for all levels of professionals from beginners to intermediate levels. The explanations of working with Data Frames and JSON data was very helpful. Cleaning data is one of the trickiest parts of data science and there is a chapter on that subject that covers many different data issues including missing data and invalid values. In the analysis sections of the book, you will see how to use regular Python code. You will also get a good introduction to using Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Seaborn libraries. I have worked with linear regression in R and was interested to see how to do the analysis with Python. Chapter 10 dives into this subject and gives thorough coverage of it. Chapter 11 works with multiple regression models which is a fairly advanced and useful technique. Section 4 contains four different cases studies, one per chapter. Each case study is very thorough and gives the readers a lot of details and shows how Python is used in the cases.There are appendices of the book for Windows and MacOS that show how to set up an Anaconda environment so you can work with Python including the Spyder and Juypter “tools”.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Murach's Python for Data Analysis (Training & Reference)

What sets the book apart from other books that I’ve found on data analysis with Python is that Python for Data Analysis covers all aspects of the process.  It’s a thorough book on how to download data from websites into python and how to visualize the data in a tabular display or graphical using typical add-on libraries such a Panda and Seaborn.  Unlike some other books on data analysis with Python, the explanations of how to perform data analysis are thorough rather than terse or with no explanations.The book also shows the use of the Python development interface Juypter Notebooks, which allows you to execute Python statements individually without the use of a debugger, so it’s a simple way to work through the examples one at a time.  You can download all of the examples in the book from the publisher’s website along with additional exercises and solutions.Lastly, there are several case studies so you can practice a complete project and compare to the case study solutions that are also provided.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Murach's Python for Data Analysis (Training & Reference)

251,"I'm a software engineer who knows his way through SQL, mostly running queries/transforms on Postgres and Redshift. The majority of my background is in building and supporting services. Having no background knowledge in Spark, I was looking for a book that explains the fundamental concepts, helps me get up running, and helps me expand my toolkit for working with ""big data"".I was able to follow along in this book fairly easily. Working on a MacBook, I did have to first install Scala, download Spark, enable Spark in IntelliJ, etc. I didn't have trouble with this as it was fairly straightforward. With my environment set up, I found the book presents every code sample in Scala and Python. I worked through the code samples, chapter by chapter, writing Scala in IntelliJ or sometimes writing Scala in the Spark CLI itself.I did take a detour from the book slightly to learn a bit more about sbt, which is the Scala build tool.For a beginner such as myself, this book is a God send, but I do wish the authors approached some things differently.In my opinion, some topics are covered in a very ""hand-wavy"" manner. For example, Chapter 4 discusses managed vs. unmanaged tables. While knowing this difference exists is helpful for the reader, the authors never discuss when you should use a managed table or an unmanaged table. They could have included that information or pointed the user to some external source. This part of Chapter 4 then shows sample code on how to create a managed table from a CSV file. However, it's not clear what should I do with that information. What are the patterns applicable to a managed table vs. unmanaged table? What are the trade-offs? Being a beginner book, I still feel the authors could have written even just 1 page, which would add significant value to this section.Sometimes the book will share some interesting tidbit but using terminology or concepts that the authors haven't really described. I found this very frustrating. For example:> (Chapter 4, page 92) ... you can create multiple SparkSessions within a single Spark application—this can be handy, for example, in cases where you want to access (and combine) data from two different SparkSessions that don’t share the same Hive metastore configurations.If you search for mentions Hive, you see the authors briefly mentioned Spark uses a Hive metastore to persist table metadata. So are the authors saying I can use one Spark installation and access table metadata from different Hive metastores? Why would I ever want to access only the metadata for different tables? Again – the use case isn't clear.As a beginner, I found this book very valuable, and I believe it is a great investment.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics
252,"The foreword and preface to this book comment that an update to the first edition, published in 2015, was long overdue. After all, the first edition makes use of Apache Spark 1.3.0, whereas this update makes use of Apache Spark 3.0.0-preview2 (the latest version available at the time of writing). For the most part, I successfully ran all notebook code out of the box using Databricks Runtime 7.6 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12), albeit minor issues are explained later in this review alongside my resolutions to these. I was, however, able to successfully run all standalone PySpark applications from chapters #2 and #3 out of the box using Apache Spark 3.0.1 and Python 3.7.9. As explained, the approach used here is intended to be conductive to hands-on learning, but with a focus on Spark's Structured APIs, so there are a few topics that aren't covered, such as the following: the older low-level Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) APIs, GraphX (Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation), how to extend Spark's Catalyst optimizer, how to implement your own catalog, and how to write your own DataSource V2 data sinks and sources.Content is broken down into 12 chapters: (1) ""Introduction to Apache Spark: A Unified Analytics Engine"", (2) ""Downloading Apache Spark and Getting Started"", (3) ""Apache Spark's Structured APIs"", (4) ""Spark SQL and DataFrames: Introduction to Built-in Data Sources"", (5) ""Spark SQL and DataFrames: Interacting with External Data Sources"", (6) ""Spark SL and Datasets"", (7) ""Optimizing and Tuning Spark Applications"", (8) ""Structured Streaming"", (9) ""Building Reliable Data Lakes with Apache Spark"", (10) ""Machine Learning with MLlib"", (11) ""Managing, Deploying, and Scaling Machine Learning Pipelines with Apache Spark"", and (12) ""Epilogue: Apache Spark 3.0"". The longest chapter is chapter #8, followed closely behind by chapters #3, #4, #5, and #10, and the most notebooks are provided for chapters #10 and #11, although this is largely due to individual notebooks dedicated to a variety of topics. This book is the fourth of four related books I've worked through, a couple years after the earlier three: ""Spark: The Definitive Guide"" (2018), ""High Performance Spark: Best Practices for Scaling and Optimizing Apache Spark"" (2017), and ""Practical Hive: A Guide to Hadoop's Data Warehouse System"" (2016). As I mentioned in an earlier review, if you are new to Apache Spark, these four texts will help enable your going in the right direction, although keep in mind that the related tech stack is evolving and you will obviously need to supplement this material with web documentation and developer forums, as well as to get hands-on with the tooling. Reading the earlier three books in opposite order of publication date enabled exposure to more current material sooner rather than later, but this was largely just a coincidence. Now that this new book is available, I recommend working through this one first. While I wouldn't discount ""Spark: The Definitive Guide"", because it provides content not in this new book and I personally think it flows better, use it very judiciously because it was created using the Spark 2.0.1 APIs.The only notebooks I wasn't able to successfully run out of the box are constrained to chapter #11. In notebook 11-3 (""Distributed Inference""), 11-5 (""Joblib""), and 11-7 (""Koalas""), FileNotFoundErrors were generated when attempting to use Pandas to read from CSV or Parquet files using ""read_csv()"" and ""read_parquet()"", respectively. In taking a look at what the community had to say, I discovered that this is a known issue, so I replaced these Pandas statements with ""spark.read.option(...).csv(""..."") and ""spark.read.option(...).parquet(""..."") instead, respectively, subsequently converting to Pandas using ""toPandas()"". In looking at the documentation, Pandas 1.0.1 is installed on both the CPU and GPU clusters for the aforementioned Databricks Runtime (the latest non-beta currently available). In notebook 11-3 (""Distributed Inference""), the following PythonException was generated when attempting to execute a ""mapInPandas()"" statement that uses a mix of numeric data types in the schema argument: ""pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert 3.0 with type str: tried to convert to double"". In the absence of decent community guidance, and because this statement is solely used for display purposes, I simply converted all of these data types to ""STRING"". According to the documentation, Pyarrow 1.0.1 is installed on both the CPU and GPU clusters for the aforementioned Databricks Runtime. I personally got the most value out of chapters #7 and #8. Chapter #7 covers optimizing and tuning Spark for efficiency, caching and persistence of data, Spark joins, and inspecting the Spark UI. Chapter #8 covers evolution of the Apache Spark stream processing engine, the programming model of Structured Streaming, the fundamentals of a Structured Streaming query, streaming data sources and sinks, data transformations, stateful streaming aggregations, streaming joins, arbitrary stateful computations, and performance tuning. In particular, I especially appreciated the sections on the two most common Spark join strategies (the broadcast hash join and shuffle sort merge join), the Spark UI, stateful streaming aggregations, and streaming joins. Well recommended for anyone making use of Spark.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics
253,"Pros:- Doesn't bog you down with the details of how many of these algorithms work.- The book provides high level overviews of what various libraries will for you.Cons:- The book builds on itself, so it does not function at all as a reference. The authors have deliberately used OOP methods to create their own classes inheriting functionality from various ML libraries.- Because of the above, you can't skip forward to a section on topic modeling for example, because there are about 500 lines worth of code that you have to define in order to make use of the functions listed around page 100 (as an example.)-It's hard to tell what each line of code is doing if you're not already very experienced with python. The authors do not explain classes, methods, inheritance or polymorphism, let alone simpler topics like list comprehensions to the reader.Bottom line, it's a very informative read, but it is not very plug & play. You have to be committed to doing things their way or else you won't be able to use code later supplied. The authors are kind enough to list the page numbers where a given function was previously delineated, but keep in mind, you're both learning how established NLP libraries work, as well as how the authors think you should blend them together into complex objects.However, if you'd like to understand less about how these APIs work and more about how they can ""connect"" with one another in depth, this book is for you.

Due to the relative large price difference, I did not bought it at the bookstore but ordered a copy from Amazon. I am a mathematician and semi-physicist by training and data scientist by vocation, and I never enjoy reading technical books except when I have to for work-related studies (I enjoy theoretical books such as Lectures on Quantum Mechanics or Group Theory in a Nutshell for Physicists or etc.) But let me say I do enjoy reading this book.  This book gives a very good introduction to fundamental concepts of natural language processing (NLP) as well as a survey of current NLP landscape (formulations, NLP libraries, applications, etc.). It is also hands-on. Good books of such kind should never be too long (A long book usu. = collection of stuff you can find by Googling).

There are many insightful hints and tricks in the book, things I did not know even though I have used Python and Pandas for a while. I have read and owned many Time Series Analysis/Forecasting textbooks, mostly filled with R code, making it hard to transition or translate these concepts into Python. There are few Python Time Series books out there, these are great resources to understand the concepts within Time Series Analysis/Forecasting, but they lack proper code implementation (and explanations) to show how things work and the best way to implement them. I think this cookbook fills that gap between the different academic textbooks so you can feel comfortable in developing solutions that can be used in a real-world setting. It takes you from theory to hands-on implementation and many valuable hints to take things further.I liked the balance between ML, DL, and Statistical Methods, but also a fair amount of Data Engineering (how to read/write to Snowflake, AWS Redshift, InfluxDB, Cloud storage, and working with SAS files ..etc.). As a reference book, I find that it can be very beneficial for me in the future as it covers a wide range of topics, the entire end-to-end process, from data pipeline, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preparation for ML, and development models using ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR, UCM, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.The recipes do a great job comparing different methods and guide you to different evaluation techniques for univariate, multivariate, multiple-seasonality, and other types of time series data. One of the chapters does a great job comparing ML/DL, Prophet, with classical statistical methods, which I thought was pretty insightful.Overall highly recommended. It is a must-have book to be on your bookshelf whenever you get stuck or need help understanding or implementing solutions for Time Series Analysis.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis, data preparation, forecasting, and model evaluation"
266,"The author has done an amazing job with this book. When I use the terms comprehensive and hands on to describe this book, I 100% mean it. It does presume you have basic python knowledge but nonetheless provides you with a crash course link to brush up your skills. It has the code snippets required for smooth learning and links to dataset on GitHub to play around.As a Data analyst, I am familiar with stats/python/modeling to an extent but this book has really helped me to deliver on my project the past few months. In a way, this book is written to guide you through a project step by step. Starts with how to read the data, handle missing values, Outlier detection, EDA, multiple modeling techniques depending on your data and complexity. The mathematics are presented briefly and appropriately for each topics, not overloading your brain with information.And that is why I would recommend this book as it’s a widely used topics and this book can be used not only as a starting point but also as a reference point while working on a time series project.PS- It explains how to set up a virtual environment",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis, data preparation, forecasting, and model evaluation"

268,"As I ventured into the world of Data Science, I realized more and more Data Science use cases in the real world are based on Time Series or some form of date/time. For example, forecasting models and anomaly detection.I usually refer to various Time Series books (mainly textbooks) to learn more about Time Series. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is a book that is dedicated Python Cookbook for Time Series! I was hoping to find one for Python. The book dives into the topic with explicit details, and every recipe hits on such essential topics. Most importantly, and my interest, is the code and how the code works. The author Tarek Atwan seems to be quite knowledgeable and passionate in this area, and it shows up in each chapter where he goes through each core concept using theory, followed by hands-on coding examples and in-depth explanations of the code. I enjoyed the ""There is more"" section for each recipe; very informative. I found this book quite helpful and use it as a reference whenever I want to understand a particular topic or gain confidence in this area.

The cookbook belongs in the toolbox of every dataset science practitioner working on time series-related projects.There are examples of code of how to visualize time series, how to detect stationarity and how to transform non-stationary time series.The cookbook has a lot of useful examples on how to handle missing data including simple imputer and iterative imputer. It explains when to use statistical methods such as z-score and modified z-score for outlier detection. It also has examples of how to use unsupervised learning for outlier detection. These code examples include how to use KNN, LOF, iForest, one-class SVM, COPOD, and PyCaret. There are example codes on how to perform time series forecasting using ARIMA, Facebook prophet, and sequential deep learning such as RNN, GRU, and LSTM.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis, data preparation, forecasting, and model evaluation"

293,"I first read Tukey's book maybe 30 years ago. It had a profound effect on me. I had always spent time playing with data: this analysis, that analysis, various plots, etc. But I had never thought of it as something that could be approached in a systematic way, and that that there were many ""easy"" back-of the envelope techniques for getting a sense of your data to quickly understand what you had. In a sense Tukey licensed the idea that data was fun to play with and something that you could just fiddle with as much as you wanted.I think of it as in the same class as mental arithmetic: sure, you have a calculator on your phone; but it's way too slow to get out of your pocket and poke at the screen when all you want is 7*9 or even 387/3. Stem-and-leaf plots let you get a quick idea of what's there, without having to write some script. These skills come in handy all the time.Like everyone, I use a computer for non-trivial data analysis. But Tukey is usually in there, somewhere. For example his box-and-whisker diagrams are in many if not all plotting packages. They look nice and you might even have used them.

While I recognize that there are a lot of good ideas in this book, I must say that far too much of the text is devoted to techniques that are only relevant if one is doing data analysis on paper. This is certainly not to slander Tukey's own extensive knowledge of computing -- simply an admission of the fact that when EDA was written, few readers would have had access to any computing resources, let alone anything comparable to those that are available today. Today, the books suffers for this.

300,"This book provides an excellent step-by-step introduction to statistics and Stata. It covers the basics of the research process, data collection, sampling, questionnaire design, and writing research (with a good overview of how to do research projects). There is a separate chapter on writing research papers, which rare in this kind of book. Notably, it also includes APA guidance.This book could be covered two semester stats course. Ideally, it would be used in an intermediate-advanced undergraduate course or a lower level graduate class. It addresses both methods and stats. It could be also used with a methods class doing a quantitative research project. Scholars might find it helpful for brushing up.The text addresses how different analyses are used in different fields, descriptive stats, hypothesis testing, covers key topics, and expected tables. It was pleasantly surprising to see regression diagnostics, logit/probit,  and regression analysis with categorical dependent variables addressed.The text uses clear straightforward language and includes no heavy math review (which often turns people away). There are news articles pop outs, framed in the current context but also relying on media that students are likely to encounter regularly. Simple definitions are provided for complicated terminology, no sidebar boxes for definitions are necessary. There are many subsections to thoroughly breakdown topics.

Have you ever have logged on to face the only to discover the friend who has a post with one single data point and uses that as the basis of their argument?  It’s perfectly acceptable to take a stance on a hot topic but you’ll come out looking foolish if you don’t understand the statistics and data points behind your argument.  Don’t be that person.In comes Naked StatisticsGrowing up, I was never fond of mathematics.  I struggled in high school with a solid 65 average (that is borderline failing in the United States), and a long believed that now just wasn’t for me.  It was until recently ago that I discovered I really do love numbers and specifically statistics.  It’s around this all the time whether through social media or my favorite thing, gaming.  Looking back, I think educators were not ever explaining to me in a way that grabbed my attention that made me want to further my math education.  The blame can’t lie solely on the educators I grew up with, so I recently took it into my own hands to further my own understanding of math.I stumbled across the audio book Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth college.  I found the narration to the enticing and upon finishing the audio book actually bought the physical copy and marked it up heavily with notes of my own.Throughout the book the author gives great detail about how statistics can truly improve our lives while the same time helping readers understand the power that comes with it and how the power can be used and negative ways as well.Now there are a few key points I want to highlight about the book:Statistics rarely offer a single “right” way of doing anythingStatistics can be powerful for establishing an argumentHoweverStatistics can also be very easy to misuseThe book opens with an explanation of the classic Monty Hall problem, which is a brain teaser in the form of a probability puzzle loosely based on the 1980’s television show “Let’s Make a Deal”.  I’d never quite comprehend it the full detail of this problem until this book.  I encourage you to look into unknown because not only to find to be interesting but also provided a great starting point for understanding for help powerful statistics can truly be.Uses of StatisticsDescription and comparisonInferenceAssessing risk and probabilityIdentifying important relationships (correlation)Descriptive Statistics“Who was the best baseball player of all time?”Descriptive statistics can be technically accurate yet pretty misleading.  The author explains that “The good news is that these descriptive statistics gives us a manageable and meaningful summary of the underlying phenomenon,” and continues with “the bad news is that any simplification invites abuse.”Wheelan highlights the Gini Index, which is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income distribution of the nation’s residents and most commonly used to measure inequality.  The problem however is that this is a mere useless stat.  It simply takes the per capita income of a nation and divides it by the number of people.  But who was actually earning how much of that income?  That is the key missing piece.Precision vs AccuracyThe author goes on to describe the differences between precision and accuracy.Precision: “The exactitude with which we can express something”Accuracy: “Measure of whether a figure is broadly consistent with the truth”Correlation“Measures the degree to which two phenomena are related to one another.Correlation coefficient: Expressed on a scale of -1 -> 11: every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the same direction-1: every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the opposite directionProbability:“Study of events in outcomes including elements of uncertainty.”There were a few key takeaways from this chapter:Don’t play Lotto (Pg. 80)You should invest in the stock market if you have a long-term investment horizon (because stocks typically have the best long-term returns)Probability is not deterministicThere are several problems with probability, however.  The 2008 Wall Street crash and financial crisis largely had to do with computers misusing probability. The VaR model, or Value at Risk, which was called “potentially catastrophic”.  Value at risk is a measure of risk in investments, and estimates how much a set of investments might lose given normal market conditions and a set time period, such as any day.  This model offered 99% reassurance about 1% is the difference between success and failure.The importance of data (Garbage in and out)When working with numbers you assume that you retrieve and good data, but no amount of fancy analysis can make up for fundamentally flawed data.Selection bias: “How have you chosen the samples you are evaluating?”Self-selection bias: “Will arise whenever individuals volunteer to be any treatment group.”Publication bias: “positive findings are more likely to be published”This distorts the research that we see, or more evidently, do not see.  This pious comes from not directly his studies themselves but from the skewed information that reaches the public.  Typically, medical journals now require that any study be registered at the beginning of the project to help combat this problem of only publishing information that researchers want to see.Inference“The process by which data speaks to us enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions.” The typical tool that researchers will use is a hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.While statistical inference offers many benefits it also comes with some significant pitfalls.  Notably, statistical inference is based on a probability, And not some sort of absolute certainty.PollingThe power polling comes also comes from the central limit theorem, similar to other forms of sampling. Where it differs however, is that we don’t care about the mean, but we actually care about the percentage, or proportion relative to our results. But again, this can be powerful for example the poll of 1000 individuals can offer meaningful insight into the attitudes of an entire nation.Regression Analysis“Allows us to quantify the relationship between a particular variable and how come we care about, while controlling for other factors.” It’s important to note there are many pitfalls of regression analysis, and is the hydrogen bomb of the statistical arsenal! Most of the studies that you read about in the newspaper are based on regression analysis.Bringing it all togetherNow that you’re more informed, consider these aspects of statistics the next time you stumble across an infographic on social media which illustrates only one point, or discover an article which takes a stand on a topic. I never realized how large of a role statistics plays in my life, but the author’s enthusiasm and clear instruction helped me to not only appreciate it, but has also further sparked my interest.If you have other books you’d like to recommend regarding math, business, or computer science, I’d love to hear about them.Key Takeaways:Statistics rarely offer a single “right” way of doing anythingStatistics can be powerful for establishing an argumentHoweverStatistics can also be very easy to misuse",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
316,"For lay people interested in better understand the world of data and statistics, this book and Tim Harford's ""The Data Dectective"" are the two books I most highly recommend.I first read this while in undergrad. Now with a few years of professional work, and a nearly completed grad program, I decided to re-read Naked Statistics. This book was one of the things that sparked my interest in statistics and data in undergrad. Now with more experience and expertise, I realize just how thorough yet succinct the text is. Wheelan writes in a very informal way that I think is approachable for a wide audience. It's certainly not a dry read like all my beloved textbooks. I particularly love how he focuses on intuition and non-technical explanations first then dives into more nitty-gritty details after he's shown how non-intimidating and intuitive the statistical idea really is. I think this approach will prevent readers from getting turned off when the mathematical details are explained (though those are also simplified significantly for lay readers).I plan on teaching data and statistics soon at my local technical college, and will use this book as my outline for an intro to stats class and make it required reading. The combination of detail and approachable content is perfect to educate without turning students off the subject. Of course more advanced texts are needed to learn how to practice statistics in the real world, but this is a good addition to those more rigorous texts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
317,"This book is excellent. It offers an easy-to-read discussion of probability and statistics.It might not be ""mathy"" enough for some folks, but for the many people who will rely on their computer to do the math, lacking equations is probably good.However, in my edition of the book, there is a printing glitch that turns the square root sign into a series of dots that cover other parts of the formula (see photos). This means the formulas are pretty much worthless:Does ....(.53)(1-.53) / 500 mean to take the square root of the first term (.53), the square root of the numerator (.53)(1-0.53) or the square root of the whole formula? There is no way to tell, unless you try the different options on your calculator and see which one is correct.This glitch seems to run throughout the book -- I don't think there are any square root signs that are properly type set.I'd happily give this book a five-star rating, but in its present form -- an entirely fixable problem if the printer / typesetter / proofreader did their job -- a couple of stars need to be subtracted.Given how many books I read and how infrequently I see this sort of glitch, I'd say this is a low probability event.The printer should recall all these defective books, shred them, and reprint them with the correct formulas. I'm not sure what the probability of W.W. Norton doing this might be.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
318,"This book serves such an incredibly important purpose in that it really explains the fundamentals of statistics in a way that can be appreciated and understood by the vast majority of reasonably educated laymen.Of course, that in itself begs the question:  so what?  What about statistics is so ""important"" that the average person should take notice?  Well, for a lot of reasons that Mr. Wheelan explains so well its hard to add anything to it, but I'll give one brief attempt for those of you bothering to read the review:  At its core, statistics is about organizing data in a meaningful way such that we can draw accurate conclusions about our environment...in other words, statistics can help us make sense of the world around us in a very meaningful and practical way.  Statistics is really just a mathematically formalized form of what our brains do intuitively, and without that core concept of filtering and making sense of the information we're exposed to we would all be paralyzed - unable to make associations, draw conclusions, or derive any meaning from our environment.  Learning would be impossible, life would be meaningless, and existence and survival itself would be impossible.  Statistics takes that core function and focuses it in very particular ways, which if done correctly, can yield amazing results that add worthwhile knowledge and positivity to life.  To quote the book, ""Statistics is the most powerful tool we have for using information to some meaningful end.""Further, if that description doesn't at least somewhat tempt you how about this:  Even if you don't care about statistics, those that have enormous influence on your life and happiness  (e.g. businesses, politicians, government organizations, media, and everybody else that has a vested interested in influencing your mindset, perspectives, and behaviors) very much care about statistics and use them, for both good and ill, to ""help"" you see and do things a certain way.  Knowledge of statistics can help transform you from ""propagandized"" to ""informed"".  This is one of my favorite aspects of the book, that is, the author acknowledges and recognizes the danger of inappropriately used statistics; he even conceived the book as an homage to 
How to Lie with Statistics: 1st (First) Edition
, and as he very correctly points out right in the introduction of the book, ""Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon:  helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands.""Amazingly, this book is a fun and enjoyable read.  No seriously.  Mr. Wheelan exposes himself as a fantastic teacher, bringing an enthusiasm and energy to the subject coupled with a gift of explaining ideas and concepts in a way that most (not just ""stat people"") can understand and appreciate.Although this isn't a ""textbook"" per se, I think it remains relevant for the whole spectrum of people from total ""newbies"" all the way to hard-core statistics researchers.  Why?  Fundamentals.  The author explains the fundamentals in a clear concise way using practical, relevant, and familiar examples from our everyday lives.  For those new to the subject you'll get an ""intro to statistics"" class from a very gifted Ivy-league professor that will give you a solid well-rooted realistic foundation that you can both apply to your everyday life as well as prepare you for higher level statistics courses if you so choose.  For those already well-versed in statistics or professionals, it will reacquaint you with why what you do matters as well as provide you a wonderful way to explain to others why what you do matters.  Personally, I'm somewhere in the middle in that I've had a reasonably high level statistics background (relative to the average college graduate, anyway) and as I read the book I kept thinking to myself, ""Man, if only I had had this before taking my first stats course!""Outstanding book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
319,"How many times have you wondered how two different people looking at the same report managed to draw totally opposite conclusions? How many times have you looked at a set of data yourself and decided that the data must be wrong because it doesn't show what you ""know"" to be true? Well, I suspect that you aren't alone. I suspect that you also have an aversion to ""doing the math"" necessary to convince yourself that the data is actually correct.Wheelan claims that ""Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands."" This is an incredibly important topic as we move forward into our increasingly connected world where we are creating data at an accelerating rate. The data is only raw knowledge, how we analyze that data is what allows us to derive useful information to create actionable knowledge. The tools we use to analyze the data is, like it or not, statistics. Wheelan gives us an easy to follow and understand overview of statistics. Even if you didn't like math in school, you will find this book useful as well as insightful.Here's the rub. No matter how hard we try, when using descriptive statistics, we lose the detail in the data. We've ""summarized"" it and just like the summary of a good book, we will miss a lot of the nuance in the story. Neither this review nor the summary of data known as descriptive statistics is an exception to that rule. And because of that loss of fidelity, we will find as Wheelan puts its, ""Smart and honest people will often disagree about what the data are trying to tell us.""Wheelan includes many examples of how statistics is enlightening and infuriating. The examples are from everyday life and you are likely to recognize them; things like ""Money Ball"" and the ""Wall Street failure."" You will learn about correlation, basic probability, the Central Limit Theorem, Inferences, Polling, Regression Analysis and more. All without tears!So why should you be interested? Because the big questions will be answered by statistical analysis and you will want to know at least enough to not be ""taken in"" by those who would purposely try and confuse you or convert you to their views using statistics and data. Wheelan believes that there are five ""large"" questions that statistics will help us answer in the future.1. What is the future of football? Will it die of concussions?2. What (if anything) is causing the dramatic rise in the incidence of autism?3. How can we identify and reward good teachers and schools?4. What are the best tools for fighting global poverty?5. Who gets to know what about you?Wheelan doesn't answer these questions. The data is still being collected and analyzed. What he has done, however, is set the reader on the right path to understanding the complexity of those questions and why there aren't any easy answers. He has given the reader at least a working knowledge of statistics so that we can decide for ourselves who is doing the best job of presenting the information and knowledge buried in ever expanding universe of dots for us to connect. The sub title of this excellent book is ""Stripping the dread from the data."" What I found is that now I know how to make sure that I strip the dread from the statistics which applies to the data. The dread is when the proper use of statistics on that data shows my cherished beliefs to be ill conceived!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data

322,"I just finished reading Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan.  This book met all my expectations.  It provides an excellent description of the field of statistics.  Although statistics is just a little over 100 years old, it has obviously become the way that we describe the world and at least an intuitive understanding of these concepts is important.  I would strongly recommend this group for two groups of people.  The first group would be people like myself who are interested in the general understanding of statistics and have no desire whatsoever to do any of the manipulations that are necessary if you want to be a real statistician.Mr. Wheelan did an excellent job in describing a number of things that are of great interest to me as a physician.  Those include his excellent discussion of type 1 and type 2 errors, the miracle of regression analysis and how powerful this can be, particularly in medical studies.  Another area is that he described the counter intuitive situation with Monty Hall on Let's Make a Deal about as well as anyone has.  So many times when I read about this, I understand it for an hour or so, but then my old way of thinking seems to slip back in.  When that happens, I am going to go back and review his chapter.The second group of people that I would recommend this for are young people that are starting out in a career in medicine or any other area and especially those that are taking their first statistics class. I think a great problem with education, especially in medical school and postgraduate medical school training, is that the students jump into the middle of statistics without understanding their purpose or their basic concepts and rarely come away with anything more than a mechanical understanding of the subject.I can highly recommend this book for any of the two groups that I have just mentioned.  I would give it a 5-star rating.  Because of this experience, I have just started to read Professor Wheelan's previous book, Naked Economics.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
323,"This book accomplishes what the author set out to do: to inform you of the rationale and logic behind statistical reasoning, which is very a very useful top-down method of understanding your data before you even set out to model. I enjoyed reading about the various practical examples, except for the annoying sports references that keep popping up. If you're not a sports fan and don't much care for anything having to do with sports like I am, you'll get bored of these pretty quickly - I found myself just glossing over or omitting an entire section while reading if it's about why some dude had some record. I DON'T CARE!Also, I find the author's tone to be extremely condescending at times when he's trying to explain technicals to his ""lay"" audience. Phrases like, ""here's how you can wrap your mind around this"" threw me off completely. I understand that your targeted audience is non-experts in statistics but that doesn't mean that we're complete idiots. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy learning a difficult mathematical or technical concept when someone is using the explain-it-to-me-like-I'm-five method because it  is simple enough that a child can understand it. But you don't talk down to children when you're trying to teach them something. Maybe it's just me and I'm overly sensitive to that kind of things but it just did not feel right when I was reading. Also, I found it hard to relate to his personal anecdotes. I got the sense that he came from a privileged background and his listing of the fun and wonderful things he's doing with his life currently just made me cringe. Yeah, that's nice that you get to publish books and go to the Taj Mahal or whatever exotic corners of the world. Thanks for sharing but not interested. Please just stick to what you do best: explain statistics! Also, his trolling of his high school teacher just tells me that he was an annoying and pompous brat.So, anyway, if you can ignore the stupid sports references and the annoying bragging, this book is plentiful in good tips for someone who is interested in being eased slowly into the higher concepts of statistical analysis, not so much the math but just the ideas behind how things are analyzed. Very big-picture and very little formulas, which I think is extremely helpful especially if you're taking a graduate data science class and you're overwhelmed with all the sigma, omega, and pi formulas. The author's very good at explaining basic stats such as mean, mode, probability, etc. and illustrating his points with examples, which is not something textbooks are keen to do. I think the author does a great job explaining, also, the rationale and logic behind statistical reports and problems as well as exposing the reader to the intuitive thinking and judgment when dealing with statisticsl. It's a fun and informative read, overall.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
324,"Yes, there are lots of ""dear reader"" type comments throughout the book. Yes, the examples and references are drawn from up-to-the-minute pop culture. And, yes, if you don't know very much about statistics and probability you can learn fairly ""painlessly"" in this book.One drawback: you really, really need to read the entire book from start to finish to really understand all of the concepts. This is not a reference book in which you can ""jump around"" or just go to the parts you have questions about.It's like being given a prescription for antibiotics; you really need to read every chapter in the book, to ""take it all."" Concepts build on previous chapters, up to the final chapter. Don't stop or you will miss out!On the other hand, this is not a book for someone who wants to quickly, at-a-glance understand probability or who wants to get a solid definition of any statistical concept, such as confidence level or regression analysis. It is not specifically a reference book.I confess, my prejudice is for more concise information without all the ""fluff."" On the other hand, I work with opinion survey statistics almost every day of my worklife, so I don't need to be lured in with tales of baseball (in which I have no interest) or discussions of what's behind the doors in Let's Make a Deal. (In fact, I have never, ever seen that show.)However, if you are in business or education or health care and don't have a complete grasp of statistics, I recommend you read this book. If you want to better understand whether you should buy a lottery ticket or buy insurance and you don't understand probability theory, I recommend this book to you. If you read media and want to have a better understanding of polls, scientific experiments, clinical trials and don't understand statistics, then I recommend this book to you.If this book piques your interest in the topics, I suggest you next obtain a couple of the more traditional, ""duller"" stat books that you can use as handy references for specific concepts. Of course, if you already have that much interest in stats, you probably already have those books. Or you know where to go online to find reference materials.There are a few tiny, tiny little things that could have been better. I think he could have included the ""name"" for symbols, such as sigma when he first introduced them. Also, I don't like the way he would ""jump"" back and forth on examples.Overall, I recommend this book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data

If you can master Kleppmann for the infrastructure grounding and this for real life use cases you'll be well on your way.  I really appreciated the fact that they point out tradeoffs *everywhere*.  That's part of the job and it can be hard to see them when we gravitate toward one option because it feels right or because of groupthink.Some minor criticisms:* the Data Mesh chapter felt tacked on, underdeveloped and in some places was incorrect or at least confusing (e.g. it says data warehouses cause loss of domain partitioning which is not true)* The book talked about tradeoffs so much it wasn't always clear why they thought taking a certain path would hurt a certain quality attribute.  ""Because there is more coupling scalability will suffer"", etc.  Perhaps. But explaining how would be great.  The book hints at some relationships between quality attributes. If that were more well-developed that could be a way to better understand these statements too.* While I'm sure it wasn't meant for effect, there is only one woman in the story portions, she is somewhat naive, a bossy PITA and has to be dragged along most of the time.

329,I thought that this book was the sequel. It’s not. Similar topics are followed. The authors did deep into the weeds. I think that some material could have been reduced and presented more tightly. There were a few times when I thought: just get to the point. The real benefit of this book is that the authors try to provide thought leadership to architects who have to make decisions found in this book. I really like that the authors intentionally state that architecture is a lot more than a design pattern and the choices architects face are not  boilerplate in terms of picking one pattern instead of another.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Software Architecture: The Hard Parts: Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed Architectures
